# SuperAgent

  Progressive high-level HTTP client for node.

  Mikeal's library is great, but when you want something in between node's low level API, and a high level API, things start to fall apart. The aim of this library is to provide a similar high-level interface, as well as a progressive one.

  __WARNING__: work in progress

## Installation

    $ npm install superagent

## TODO

  - progressive multipart support (req / res)
  - schema relative redirects
  - SSL

## Examples

### GET

 Below is a simple __GET__ request, with buffered body available at `res.body` and `body`. By default when passing a callback there is no need to listen on "end", as the callback is invoked when the response is complete.
 
     var agent = require('superagent');
    
     agent.get('http://google.com', function(err, res, body){
       console.log(res.statusCode);
       console.log(body);
     });

### GET Query String

 The second object passed becomes the querystring:
 
     agent.get('http://google.com', { search: 'foobar' }, function(err, res, body){
       // whatever
     });

### Redirects

 The default maximum redirects defaults to `5`, however we can alter this with `.redirects(n)` or `.maxRedirects(n)`. 

     var req = agent.get('http://google.com', function(err, res, body){
       console.log(res.statusCode);
       console.log(body);
     });

     req.on('redirect', function(location){
       console.log('redirecting to %s', location);
     });

### Buffered Responses

 By default data is not buffered, and you must listen on response "data" events like you normally would. SuperAgent provides the `.buffer()` and `.parse()` methods, which are equivalent, and check `Content-Type` header and associate a parser with the response.

 For example the following will automatically parse/buffer `text/*`, `application/json`, and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` responses:
 
      agent
      .get('http://localhost:3000')
      .parse()
      .on('response', function(res){
        res.on('end', function(){
          console.log(res.body);
        });
      }).end();

 Sometimes it is not ideal to simply halt processing until the data is buffered / parsed, which is why SuperAgent gives you the choice of this API, or the callback API.

### POSTing JSON

 Posting some JSON is easy, the `.json()` method writes a jsonified version of the object passed, providing a content-length and content-type.

    agent
      .post('http://localhost:3000')
      .json({ foo: 'bar' });

### POSTing Form Data

  The same can be done for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data, using the `.form()` method.
  
      agent
        .post('http://localhost:3000')
        .form({ foo: 'bar' });

### Defining A Parser

 Currently the parsers may act only on the complete buffered body, however their definitions are extremely simple:
 
    agent.parse('text/*', function(str){ return str; });
    agent.parse('application/json', JSON.parse);
    agent.parse('application/x-www-form-urlencoded', require('qs').parse);
